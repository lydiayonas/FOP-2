Write a program which prints a table listing the number of occurrences of the lower-case characters 'a' to 'z' in a file "Sheet5Ex5.cpp". Declare only one variable of type "ifstream", one variable of type "char", and two variables of type "int". The program should produce output such as the following
	         CHARACTER                     OCCURRENCES
		a                  		 38

		c                  		 35

Write a function that takes the name of a file (char*) that  contains integer records, an array of int and the address of a variable count. Define the function to read the file into the array.
